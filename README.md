I'm a Senior Research Associate at the [Gloucester Marine Genomics Institute (GMGI)](www.gmgi.org). I have been at GMGI since 2017 and have worked on a wide range of projects applying sequencing technologies to marine environmentals and organisms. Some of these include sequencing reference genomes for the American lobster (*Homarus americanus*), the red sea urchin (*Mesocentrotus franciscanus*), and the Jonah crab (*Cancer borealis*); whole ecosystem biodiversity studies of unique marine environments (e.g. Stellwagen Bank NMS); and metagenomics/transcriptomics of the Moytirra hydrothermal vent system.  

I completed my Masters in Marine Biology with [Dr. Joshua Voss](https://vosslab.weebly.com/) at FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute.
